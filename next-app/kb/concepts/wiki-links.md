# Wiki Links

Wiki-style links connect documents together using double brackets.

## Syntax

Use `[[document-name]]` to link to another document:
- `[[README]]` → links to the root README
- `[[projects/sharp]]` → links to projects/sharp.md

## Backlinks

When document A links to document B, document B will show A in its backlinks section.

This creates a bidirectional web of connected ideas.
